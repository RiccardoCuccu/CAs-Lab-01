# CAs Lab 11
Laboratory 11 of the Computer Architectures course of the master degree in Embedded System (Electronic Engineering) of Politecnico di Torino, academic year 2019/2020.<br/>
Tested in Keil uVision5.

## Exercise 1
Implement Simon Game.<br/>
Using Key1, Key2, Int0 buttons, the player has to repeat a random sequence, displayed using LEDs 4, 5, 6.<br/>
If the sequence inserted by the player is the same as the one to emulate, the player wins. At this point the game repeats, increasing by 1 the length of the sequence.<br/>
Otherwise the player loses, and the game starts again from sequence length 1.

### Sequence shown by LEDs
To show a sequence of length `n`, the timer has to trigger `n`\*2 interrupts, with an interval of 1,5s.<br/>
In interrupts 1, 3, 5, ..., `n`\*2 â€“ 1 (odd), the interrupt handler of the timer generates a random number between 0 and 2 and powers on the corresponding LED: 0 -> led 4, 1 -> led 5, 2 -> led 6.<br/>
In interrupts 2, 4, 6, ..., `n`\*2 (even) the interrupt handler powers off the only lit LED.

### Random Number Generation
To obtain random numbers, you can check the value of the timer counter.<br/>
Computing the modulo 3 of timer counter, it is possible to obtain a random number between 0 and 2.<br/>
Suggestions:
- use a timer different from the one used to handle the power on/off for the LEDs;
- the timer counter can also be checked to handle the bouncing of a button.

### Outcome of the game
If the player has pressed the buttons in the correct sequence, the 4-11 LEDs power on according to the binary number `n` to be displayed (LED 11 is least significant bit). The game starts again with `n` = `n` + 1 as soon as the player pushes the button.<br/>
If instead the `i`-th button is input wrong, on the 4-11 LEDs the `i` value is displayed. The game starts again with `n` = 1 as soon as the player pushes the button.

### Suggestions
To show the binary number `x` on LEDs 4-11, it is sufficient to assign to the low 8 bits of LPC_GPIO2->FIOPIN the value `x`.<br/>
The handler of the timer has to manage their powering on with a random sequence and store that sequence in a statically allocated array (max 256 elements).<br/>
The handler of the buttons has to verify that the pressed button corresponds to the `i`-th element of the sequence stored in memory.<br/>
It is recommended to use a global variable, shared among handlers of timers and buttons, in order to keep track of the current situation of the game.
